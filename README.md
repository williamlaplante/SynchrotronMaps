# SynchrotronMaps

Project aiming at quantifying extra-galactic contamination in Synchrotron maps using the correlation function. The ultimate goal is to provide the appropriate foreground corrections to reduce contamination in these maps. 

## Directory Structure

 - code : where all the code is located
 - data : This directory is not present on the remote github platform (for obvious reasons), but it is crucial to make some of the code run. It contains all the dataused in the modules found in the code directory. To get access to the data folder, you can contact me directly.
