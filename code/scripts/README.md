# Directory Structure

- computations : where computational scripts are located. If the job has some output with no required target directory where to store it, it goes into the subdirectory out.

- plotting : where plotting scripts are located. Usually takes output of computation files from out, and executes some plotting tasks.

- results : where plotting scripts dump their figures.
